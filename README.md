# jmeter-javastep
This item is a rudimentary implementation of a JAVA step for the JMeter application.

The JAVA step allows for wrapping any type of class in order to use it as a sample in JMeter for testing purposes.

Package in a JAR en place it in $JMETER_HOME/lib/ext/. JMeter will pick it up. You can access it by choosing the java request.
